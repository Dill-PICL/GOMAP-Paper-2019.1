Reproducing this paper or using part of the software
------------
To make it all easy for you, we have bundled everything that's required to run our analyses and typeset the paper in a [singularity container](https://sylabs.io/).
Please [install singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.3/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps) and then follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Download the git repository
git clone https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1.git

# 2. Change into the newly downloaded folder
cd GOMAP-Paper-2019.1

# 3. Pull the singularity container
singularity pull library://merlin/default/gomap-paper-2019.1

# 4. Access the container
singularity shell gomap-paper-2019.1_latest.sif
```

You will now be able to re-perform all our analyses and re-typeset our paper. You may also play with the data if you want to explore what changes for yourself.
