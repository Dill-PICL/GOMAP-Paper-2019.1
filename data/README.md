## Data
Input datasets and recipes for the trees to build and term sets to generate; the files in this folder are provided by us/the user and remain unchanged by any analysis.
- [go_annotation_sets](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/tree/master/data/go_annotation_sets) - GO annotation sets generated by GOMAP or downloaded from Gramene or Phytozome, as they are published there.
- [go.obo.gz](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/blob/master/data/go.obo.gz) - Gene Ontology downloaded from http://geneontology.org/docs/download-ontology/ .
- [goa_arabidopsis.gaf.gz](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/blob/master/data/goa_arabidopsis.gaf.gz) - Arabidopsis GOA file used in the quality evaluation, downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/arabidopsis_release .
- [n_genes_per_genome](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/blob/master/data/n_genes_per_genome.csv) - Number of gene models in each genome as per the number of sequences in the FASTA file used to generate the annotations, used for the quantity evaluation.
- [desired_trees](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/tree/master/data/desired_trees) - Instructions/Recipes on which dendrograms to generate. These are used as the input for the treebuilding script which then gathers the appropriate annotation sets and performs distance- and character-based dendrogram construction.
- [set_operations](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1/tree/master/data/set_operations) - Recipes for GO annotation set operations to answer questions such as "Which terms are present in all legumes as well as in cotton but not present in cannabis". These files are used as input for the `set_arithmetics.rb` script (in the treebuilding analysis).
