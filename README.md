Reproducing this paper or using part of the software
------------
To make it all easy for you, we have bundled everything that's required to run our analyses in a [singularity container](https://sylabs.io/).
You may also just want to use our software for your own data or play around with our data to explore it for yourself.
Please [install singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.3/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps) and then follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Download the git repository and its submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-Paper-2019.1.git

# 2. Change into the newly downloaded folder
cd GOMAP-Paper-2019.1

# 3. Pull the singularity container
singularity pull library://merlin/default/gomap-paper-2019.1

# 4a. To re-perform all analyses (e.g. after you've modified data or scripts)
./gomap-paper-2019.1_latest.sif # OR
singularity run gomap-paper-2019.1_latest.sif

# 4b. To perform steps manually or use the installed software for something else, enter the container
singularity shell gomap-paper-2019.1_latest.sif
# You can now either do things manually or use rake to run specific analyses. You can type rake -T for a list of all available tasks.
```
