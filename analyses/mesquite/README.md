These are the files that reopen our analyses on [Mesquite](https://www.mesquiteproject.org/) Version 3.61. 
After downloading Mesquite, open the file called Crops under `results/mesquite-files.tar.gz` through Mesquite. 
This file contains taxa information, the Character Matrix for both leaves and internal nodes, and the trace character history for every character in the matrix. 
We have also provided the Crops Character Matrix file as a separate file. 
The Expected Tree file can be linked to the Crops Project to generate the trees to trace character history.
