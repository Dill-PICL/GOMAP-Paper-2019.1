These are the analyses that were done for the paper.
If you want to re-run one of them or use them on your own data, access the singularity container as described in the main README and enter the directory of the respective analysis you want to run, all paths are relative from there.
So, for example, to re-run the quantity analysis:
```bash
cd analyses/quantity
Rscript quantity.R
```
